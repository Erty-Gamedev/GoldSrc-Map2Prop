    NOTES:  1.  Algorithm: the signed changes of the direction angles
                from one side to the next side must be all positive or
                all negative, and their sum must equal plus-or-minus
                one full turn (2 pi radians). Also check for too few,
                invalid, or repeated points.
            2.  No check is explicitly done for zero internal angles
                (180 degree direction-change angle) as this is covered
                in other ways, including the `n < 3` check.
